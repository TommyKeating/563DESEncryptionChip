# 563DESEncryptionChip
Final Project for CSE563, CMOS chip that will output an encrypted version of the 8 bit input based on 10 bit key.   
To be completed by May 9th.   
This project was worked on by myself and partner Will Hamic.  
# To run Python code   
On line 1 and line 2 of the script there are 2 lists called IN and KEY.   
If you fill the IN list with the 8 bit input you want to test and the KEY list with the 10 bit key you want to test, you can then run the program to return the 8 bit encrypted output.
